This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook program for classifying tweet data from Twitter using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm and **TF-IDF**, utilizing the **Scikit-learn** library.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  
### 📁 `Kode` (Code)  
This folder contains the scripts used for my thesis, with the following workflow:  
1. **Data Crawling** – Collecting tweet data  
2. **Data Preprocessing & Visualization** – Cleaning and analyzing data  
3. **NaN Detection (Optional)** – Handling missing values caused by formatting issues (e.g., missing commas)  
4. **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification** – Training and evaluating the model  

### 📁 `Data` (Dataset)  
This folder includes three datasets:  
- **Dataset** – The raw data, manually labeled  
- **Preprocessed Dataset** – Cleaned data, without stemming  
- **Preprocessed + Stemmed Dataset** – Cleaned data with stemming applied
